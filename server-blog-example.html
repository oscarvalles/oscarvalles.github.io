            Dell servers are known for their robustness and flexibility, often favored for their
            cost-effectiveness and ease of integration into existing IT environments. On the other
            hand, IBM servers have a longstanding reputation for unparalleled reliability and
            advanced hardware management capabilities.
        </p>
        <h2>Performance and Scalability</h2>
        <p>
            Both Dell and IBM offer servers that cater to various performance needs, from entry-level
            systems to high-performance computing clusters. Dell's PowerEdge series and IBM's Power Systems
            are designed to handle demanding workloads with efficiency and scalability.
        </p>
        <h2>Reliability and Support</h2>
        <p>
            IBM has historically been recognized for its exceptional build quality and rigorous testing
            standards, making their servers a preferred choice for mission-critical applications that
            require maximum uptime. Dell, while also providing reliable servers, often appeals to businesses
            seeking a balance between performance and cost-effectiveness.
